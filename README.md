# newsletter-frontend

A school project. Effectively, just a demonstration of a login/subscription system that relies on a separately hosted mongodb database (on atlas), a backend (on heroku) and a frontend, hosted right here.

Instructions for usage will be added later. If you don't know what this is, though, I doubt you'll find anything of interest here!
